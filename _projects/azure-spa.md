The project is a partnership program with the Northridge Cooperative Homes Community, San Francisco Parks Alliance, and Academy of Art University's B-Lab design-build program. The program is designed to ensure that there is a collaborative effort of dealing with social programs such as the existence of the food deserts. The location for the program is ideal as there is a lack of healthy foods and fresh organic, affordable food. The program is anchored through the community in providing civic education to the people on food and agricultural produce. Food and agricultural education would facilitate better skills and sustainable methods of crop cultivation and food preservation. The Pavilion promotes a safe place with zero tolerance on violence and hatred serving as a sanctuary for all users and places for investment. The integration of the programs with the community is enhanced through the local youths, women organizations, and community meetings. The Pavilion serves as the right ground for cooking, eating, storytelling. The design of the program is based on a circular gathering spot, meant to draw-in people, creating a stronger network within the community.
