Project Home heals. People gather to remember as the river flows. We approach “Home” from a framed pathway into an expansive space of renewal. The past, present and future meet as art and prayer remind survivors of lost tales. The project is a central place for people to gather and spread awareness of the war. The project uses local materials, has natural ventilation and rainwater collecting system.

You enter the space by walking through the long entry path, once inside the expansive area is the exhibition area. The East side is softly blocking the view by the louver screen. The supporting west side wall is where the contemplative artwork hangs. The vertical open space between supporting wall and roof create a perfect circulation system and also brings in light. The contemplation room on the north side is enclosed by solid dirt walls except for the sliver like side roof opening. The solid dirt walls have good acoustic control. The rainwater channel resist on the top of the soil slope is parallel to the roof‘s edge sending the rainwater into the water tank. The project is environmentally friendly and zero energy cost.
