Chongqing is a sprawling municipality at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in southwestern China. 

Mountainous & Canyon Terrain, Long history with rich traditional architectural elements. The analysis shows that the north and west sides of the site are urban interfaces, and the south and east sides are natural interfaces. At the same time, the site itself is located in the connecting zone between the city and nature, so the hotelâ€™s landscape experience should be maximized, and the tower volume should be arranged in the direction of the landscape, mainly to the south and east.
