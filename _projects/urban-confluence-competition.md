Arena Green located in the west of downtown San Jose is a natural urban hub - with the local shopping center within 5 mins drive distance up north; downtown commercial building district on the east across the CA87 highway; low density residential district on the south; existing regional arena center bent with the contemplated mix-use google village included San Jose Diridon transit station along the west side – and has a diverse mix of residents, visitor and worked who active and animate the arena green park. In the future, Arena Green park’s surrounding is going to experience enormous growth with both residence population and job the growth that would vivid the whole west San Jose downtown area. 

The site contains two routes for Los Gatos Creek and Guadalupe River which spontaneously serves as a barrier between the western and eastern sections of the downtown area. This brings the design forge to connect between neighborhoods by creating the unitary central civic space. Extracting the river flow as the essential formalization to express the life circle the movement that links all the programs - the bike path, pedestrian bridges, amphitheaters, and integrated semi-private/ semi-public seating spot

Consider the finish material for the lifting structure would be specially treated redwood strips for longer life cycle and create the natural wood twig features for local birds to build nests on. The lighting candle for both lifting pedestrian path and ground pedestrian is relatively comfortable for nature creatures to be under 1.0 ca/ft. 

The goal is to not only create an interim public space, but instead to create a community space to revitalize the San Jose downtown and yet have the design piece as one of the city symbols that represents harmonious nature.
