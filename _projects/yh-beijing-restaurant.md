Located in the famous Hippies neighborhood of San Francisco. Tall ceilings, modern dome-shaped lamps, and an open bar with wood drop-down ceiling decoration evoke a wooden nature in the whole dining area. 

By cooperating with local artists, the art piece exhibition becomes the highlight of the main dining area. The phenomenal wooden transparent partition walls divide the project into different zones, meanwhile increase the visual depth. Key details within the design were used throughout each of the rooms to keep matters cohesive -from brass finishes and dinnerware to the lighting's overall effect. 

The color palette comprises a combination of soft and decent pastel hues that the design duo in ted to be nostalgic for the restaurantâ€™s target demographic.
